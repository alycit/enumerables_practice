# Enumerables Pactice with Objects

This is a repo where you can practice some enumerables with various objects. Use appropriate enumerables to write each method.

Please read all the code and comments first. The comments tell you what to build for each method

No tests have been provided, but you can create a spec folder and add your own specs if you wish

Data is provided and loaded into the runner for you.  Driver code is already provided in `runner.rb`. Run `ruby runner.rb` and add any driver code as needed to test your methods.

## Release 0

Start with the `gpa` method in the student class.  That will be required to move on to release 1.  The details of what is required in the method are provided in the comment.  Feel free to make smaller single responsibility methods as needed.

## Release 1

Work through the methods in the `student_report.rb` file from top to bottom.  You may end up refactoring as you further implement methods.  The details of what is required in the method are provided in the comment above each method.  Feel free to make smaller single responsibility methods as needed.
